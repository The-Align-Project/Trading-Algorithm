I'll create a comprehensive trading algorithm framework that includes multiple strategies, risk management, and backtesting capabilities. This will be a complete system you can customize and extend.I've created a comprehensive, production-ready trading algorithm with the following key features:

## Core Components:

**1. Strategy Framework**
- Momentum strategy (trend-following)
- Mean reversion strategy (contrarian)
- Modular design for easy strategy addition

**2. Technical Indicators**
- Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Bollinger Bands
- ATR (Average True Range)
- Volume analysis

**3. Risk Management**
- Position sizing based on risk percentage
- Stop-loss orders (2x ATR)
- Take-profit orders (3x ATR)
- Maximum position size limits (10% of capital)

**4. Backtesting Engine**
- Historical data analysis
- Performance metrics calculation
- Trade execution simulation
- Portfolio value tracking

**5. Performance Analytics**
- Total return calculation
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate analysis
- Detailed trade history

## Key Features:

- **Real Data**: Uses Yahoo Finance for live market data
- **Risk Control**: Automatic stop-loss and take-profit execution
- **Multiple Strategies**: Easy to switch between momentum and mean reversion
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics for strategy evaluation
- **Scalable**: Can easily add new symbols and strategies

## Usage:
The algorithm is ready to run and will backtest both strategies on Apple (AAPL) stock. You can modify the symbol, timeframes, and risk parameters as needed.

To use this algorithm:
1. Install required packages: `pip install pandas numpy yfinance`
2. Run the script to see backtesting results
3. Modify strategies or add new ones as needed
4. Integrate with a broker API for live trading

The algorithm includes proper error handling, realistic transaction costs consideration, and follows professional trading practices. It's designed to be both educational and practically useful for algorithmic trading.
