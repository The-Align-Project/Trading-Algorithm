I'll create an integrated version of the trading algorithm that works with Alpaca's broker API for live trading. This will include real-time data, order management, and portfolio tracking.I've created a comprehensive Alpaca-integrated trading algorithm! Here are the key features:

## 🚀 **Alpaca Integration Features**

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api pandas numpy yfinance
```

2. **Get Alpaca API Keys:**
   - Sign up at [Alpaca Markets](https://alpaca.markets)
   - Generate API keys from your dashboard
   - Start with paper trading (free)

3. **Configure the Algorithm:**
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual credentials
   - Set `paper=True` for paper trading (recommended)
   - Customize watchlist and risk parameters

## 🔧 **Key Components**
