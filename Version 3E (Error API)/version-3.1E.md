I've fixed the trading algorithm to handle the dependency issues gracefully. Here are the key improvements:

## ðŸ”§ **Fixed Issues:**

1. **Graceful Dependency Handling**: The code now catches import errors and provides fallbacks
2. **WebSockets Issue**: Added proper error handling for the yfinance websockets dependency
3. **Sample Data Fallback**: When yfinance isn't available, it generates realistic sample data
4. **Simplified Indicators**: Falls back to custom implementations when TA-Lib isn't available
5. **Optional ML**: Disables ML features when scikit-learn isn't available

## ðŸ†• **New Features:**

1. **Dependency Checker**: Shows which packages are available at startup
2. **Auto-Installation**: Option to automatically install missing dependencies
3. **Fallback Systems**: Works even with minimal dependencies
4. **Better Error Handling**: More robust error catching throughout
5. **Improved Logging**: Better status reporting and error messages

## ðŸš€ **How to Run:**

1. **Quick Start** (with current dependencies):
```bash
python version-3.py
```

2. **Install Missing Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install websockets>=11.0 yfinance scikit-learn scipy
```

3. **For TA-Lib** (optional but recommended):
```bash
# macOS
brew install ta-lib
pip install TA-Lib

# Windows
pip install TA-Lib

# Linux
sudo apt-get install libta-lib-dev
pip install TA-Lib
```

## ðŸŽ® **Available Modes:**

1. **Simulation Mode**: Uses sample data, perfect for testing
2. **Live Trading**: With Alpaca API (requires credentials)
3. **Backtest Mode**: Historical analysis
4. **Dependency Installer**: Auto-installs missing packages

The algorithm will now work even with minimal dependencies, using simplified features and sample data for demonstration. As you install more dependencies, additional features will automatically become available.

Try running it now - it should work without the websockets error!
