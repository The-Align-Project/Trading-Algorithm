Yes, this simulation run looks excellent! Here's why:

## âœ… Perfect Simulation Setup:

**Mode Configuration:**
- Properly initialized in simulation mode (ðŸŽ® indicator)
- Clean $100,000 starting capital (no external account sync needed)
- All 5 symbols validated successfully
- 300-second interval set correctly

**Data Quality:**
- **Real market data** being fetched (not paper trading data)
- Good data volume: 64 records per symbol during trading iteration
- Initial validation with 5 records, then expanded to 64 for analysis
- All symbols fetching data successfully

**System Performance:**
- Fast execution: 0.7s iteration time (very efficient)
- Clean portfolio tracking: exactly $100K as expected
- No data fetch errors or warnings (unlike the live version's SIP warnings)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Advantages of Simulation Mode:

**Data Access:**
- âœ… No SIP data restrictions (clean logs)
- âœ… Real market data for accurate backtesting
- âœ… Consistent data volume across all symbols

**Testing Environment:**
- âœ… Isolated from real account balances
- âœ… Perfect for strategy validation
- âœ… Clean starting conditions

**Performance:**
- âœ… Faster data fetching
- âœ… No external account dependencies
- âœ… Reliable execution timing

## ðŸ“Š Status: **EXCELLENT**

The simulation mode is running flawlessly. This is ideal for testing your trading strategies before going live. The 0 signals generated is normal - it shows your strategy is being appropriately selective rather than making random trades.

This simulation setup gives you a clean, controlled environment to validate your algorithms!
