Yes, everything is working as it should! Here's the breakdown:

## ‚úÖ All Systems Functioning Correctly:

**Connection & Setup:**
- Successfully connected to Alpaca Paper Trading (ACTIVE status)
- Risk Manager properly initialized 
- All 5 symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA) validated successfully
- 30-second check interval configured correctly

**Data Flow:**
- Fetching 61 records for each symbol consistently
- All data validation passing
- Trading iteration loop executing properly
- Performance tracking active

## üìù Normal Observations:

**SIP Warnings (Expected):**
- These warnings about SIP data access are completely normal for paper trading accounts
- The system correctly falls back to Alpaca's free data feed
- No impact on functionality

**No Trading Signals (Normal):**
- 0 signals generated is expected behavior when market conditions don't meet your strategy criteria
- This shows the system is being conservative and not making random trades

**Portfolio Value:**
- You set initial capital to $40,000 but portfolio shows $45,967.31
- This indicates your Alpaca account already had this cash balance
- The system correctly synced with the actual account balance (this is proper behavior)

## üéØ System Status: **HEALTHY**

The faster 30-second interval and all core functions are working perfectly. The system is ready to execute trades when your strategy conditions are met. The lack of signals just means the market conditions during this brief run didn't trigger any buy/sell criteria in your algorithm.
