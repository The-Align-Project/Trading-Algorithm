Looking at your trading engine logs, things appear to be working mostly as expected, but there are a few observations:

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well:
- **Connection successful**: Connected to Alpaca Paper Trading with ACTIVE account status
- **Data fetching**: Successfully fetching 61 records for all 5 symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA)
- **Validation**: All symbols are being properly validated
- **System flow**: The main trading loop is executing correctly
- **Cleanup**: Proper shutdown and performance report generation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Expected):
- **SIP data warnings**: These are normal for paper trading accounts - you're getting warnings about not having access to premium SIP (Securities Information Processor) data, but the system correctly falls back to Alpaca's free data feed
- **No trading signals**: The system generated 0 signals, which could be normal depending on market conditions and your strategy parameters

## üîç Things to Check:
1. **Portfolio value discrepancy**: You started with $100,000 but current portfolio shows $45,967.31. This suggests either:
   - Previous trading sessions occurred
   - Manual trades were made outside the system
   - The Alpaca account already had existing positions/cash levels

2. **Signal generation**: If you expect more trading activity, you might want to review your strategy parameters or market conditions during this timeframe.

The system is functioning correctly from a technical standpoint. The SIP warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality. The main question is whether the portfolio value difference is expected based on your trading history.
